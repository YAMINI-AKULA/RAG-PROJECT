📚 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Started by importing essential libraries and setting up the Wikipedia API wrapper for seamless querying.

📄 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠: Efficiently loaded and chunked documents from URLs to streamline data processing.

🧠 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Leveraged OpenAI/ Hugging face embeddings to build a powerful vector store(chroma db), enhancing semantic search capabilities.

🛠️ 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥: Developed a specialized tool for precise searching within LangSmith documentation(used for my project), you could also use your own documents here.

⚙️ 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐮𝐩: Configured ChatOpenAI to develop an intelligent agent that generates responses based on retrieved information. This included optimizing parameters for better performance, integrating LangChain prompts to enhance knowledge, combining language models and retrieval tools for versatility, and implementing an efficient executor for seamless query handling.

🖥️ 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐥𝐢𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭:
Designed an intuitive user interface using Streamlit for a seamless user experience that invokes the custom made retrieval tool or Wikipedia search depending on the query.
